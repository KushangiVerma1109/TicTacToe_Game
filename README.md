# TicTacToeGame

# This C program implements a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns to mark spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The game ends when one player wins or the grid is full and results in a draw.

   # Checks all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).
   # Returns 1 if a player wins.
   # Returns 0 if all positions are filled without a win (draw).
   # Returns -1 if the game should continue.
